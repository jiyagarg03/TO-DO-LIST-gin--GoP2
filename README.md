# Go Todo List API (Gin)

This is my **second Go project**, where I rebuilt a **Todo List REST API** using the **Gin framework**.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete todos (CRUD)
- Built with Gin on top of Go
- In-memory storage
- Concurrency-safe using `sync.Mutex`

## Endpoints

- `GET /todos`
- `POST /todos`
- `PUT /todos?id=`
- `DELETE /todos?id=`

## About

This project helped me understand how Gin simplifies routing and JSON handling compared to `net/http`.
